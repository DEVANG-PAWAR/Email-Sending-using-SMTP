Email Sending using SMTP
This project demonstrates how to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in Python. It utilizes the smtplib library to connect to an SMTP server (like Gmail), authenticate with login credentials, and send messages to one or more recipients. The application can be extended to include subject lines, HTML content, and file attachments. This is useful for automating notifications, contact forms, or bulk messaging systems.
